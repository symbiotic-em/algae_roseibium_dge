# DGE, GO MWU and Growth Stats Analysis for Long-Term Cocultures of Symbiodiniaceae-Roseibium 
Accompanying script and input/output files to the manuscript in preparation:
"Symbiodinium-Roseibium establish a stable coculture and exhibit synergistic growth effects" by Emily G Aguirre, et.al

Here, we grew axenic cultures of S. linucheae (strain SSA01) and Roseibium in B12-limited media for 12 weeks, followed by differential gene expression analysis comparing controls (axenic SSA01 or axenic Roseibium) and coculture treatments. 

All analyses can be re-created by starting with the raw .fastq files available upon request to EG Aguirre (emilyagu@usc.edu or aguirre.emilyg@gmail.com) or CD Kenkel (ckenkel@usc.edu)
A full annotation of the Roseibium sp. Sym1 genome can be found at JGI IMG/MER under Project ID: Gp0612333, under "Roseibium sp. Sym1 re-assembly" (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/projects?id=Gp0612333).
